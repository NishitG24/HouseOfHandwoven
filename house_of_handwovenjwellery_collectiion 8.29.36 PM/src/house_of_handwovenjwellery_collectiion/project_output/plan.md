A markdown document containing User Stories, a list of required API endpoints,  and UI component requirements. Here are some examples:

  * "I want to buy a house in New York City."
  * "To connect with WhatsApp for placing orders, I need to use the following API endpoints: [insert API endpoint here]."
  * "To create an account on MongoDB Atlas, I need to use the following API endpoints: [insert API endpoint here]."
  * "To retrieve information about a house in New York City using the following API endpoints: [insert API endpoint here]."
  * "To send an order for a house in New York City using the following API endpoints: [insert API endpoint here]."

Note that this is just one possible answer to the user story. There are many other options available depending on the requirements of the user story.
